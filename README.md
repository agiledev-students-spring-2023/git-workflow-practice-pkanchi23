[EBay Hiring Multiple Web3 Roles Following NFT Marketplace Acquisition](https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2023/02/02/ebay-hiring-multiple-web3-roles-following-nft-marketplace-acquisition/)

## Importance:
The technology space has been taking beating after beating lately. Tightening monetary policies have forced tech company multiples to compress, causing the supposed excess of techonology companies to come crashing down, or so the story supposedly goes. Share buybacks of $40 billion at Meta, in spite of layoffs and lacking return offers have made questionable whether all companies are succumbing to economic pressure or are using the opportunity to *cull the heard*. Either way, being involved in the tech scene has been difficult over the last couple of weeks. These issues are compounded for cryptocurrencies and other web3 technologies. While certain more theoretical cases like ZK-chains have been seeing stability, the industry as a whole has been rocked by scandals and the loss of trust resulting from the FTX fallout. The article linked above dives into EBay looking to bolster its recent acquisition of [KnownOrigin](https://knownorigin.io/). EBay has been on a tear of business line expansions during COVID, launching competitors to the likes of [Stockx](https://stockx.com/) and [Goat](https://www.goat.com/). However, seeing the company continue to support its growth ventures in the turn of the economy shows at least a short term optimistic support of their acquisition vision. This also provides a glimmer of optimisim for the software engineer as well. Companies are still willing to support higher risk ventures, like crypto/NFT. Although the biggest tech players may be slowing down, it also shows that more stable companies continue to shine. More fundamental tech verticals like payments, marketplaces, and infrastructure (cloud compute, DevOps) can still show promise.
